## Single Atomic Commit Message

For commits to grid, I'll always recommend that simple MR's (like this one) be squashed into a single commit, here's an [excerpt](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-how-to-squash-multiple-git-commits?course=how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) that explains this process.

Often, project maintainers prefer that a single pull request be represented by a single commit. It makes the git history cleaner and easier to understand. So before your pull request is merged youâ€™ll want to do an interactive git rebase to squash all of your commits and fix your commit message.
